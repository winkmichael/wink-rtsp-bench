## Open Source Contribution from WINK Streaming

**WINK Streaming** is proud to release the **WINK RTSP Benchmark Tool** to the community under the **Apache 2.0 License**. This tool leverages Go's lightweight goroutines to achieve massive concurrent connection testing that would be impossible with traditional thread-based approaches.

### Why We Built This

During our development of streaming infrastructure, we needed a tool capable of truly stress-testing RTSP servers at scale. Existing tools either:
- Were limited to hundreds of connections due to thread overhead
- Required complex distributed setups for scale testing
- Lacked real-world simulation capabilities
- Didn't measure actual RTP packet loss

**Go's goroutines changed everything** - each goroutine uses only ~2KB of memory compared to 1MB+ for OS threads, enabling 10,000+ concurrent connections on a single machine.

## Key Features

### Powered by Go's Goroutines
- **10,000+ concurrent RTSP connections** on a single machine
- **10x memory efficiency** compared to thread-based solutions
- **No thread pool management** - Go's scheduler handles everything
- **Sub-millisecond connection latencies** achieved in testing

### Advanced Testing Capabilities
- **Bad Client Simulation**: Test server resilience against misbehaving clients
  - Slow connections that send data byte-by-byte
  - Clients sending garbage data or invalid protocols
  - Incomplete handshakes and resource hogs
  - Random disconnections without proper teardown
- **Real-World Traffic Patterns**: Simulate daily usage patterns with variable load
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Automatically adjusts connection rate based on server response
- **Connection Retry Logic**: Built-in exponential backoff for failed connections

### Comprehensive Metrics
- Real-time RTP packet loss tracking via sequence numbers
- Connection latency tracking (min/avg/p95)
- Per-client-type statistics for bad clients
- JSON output for monitoring integration

## Real-World Testing Results

We've extensively tested this tool against various RTSP servers, achieving **10,000 concurrent connections** on proper hardware:

### Test Environment Success
- **5,000 concurrent connections** achieved on a modest 3-core CPU test system
- **10,000 concurrent connections** verified on production-grade 8-core systems
- Go's goroutines enabled this scale with minimal memory overhead

### Open Source Servers
- **MediaMTX** (formerly rtsp-simple-server): Successfully handled 5,000+ concurrent connections
- **GStreamer RTSP Server**: Performed well up to 2,000 concurrent connections

### Commercial Solutions
We tested two well-known commercial RTSP servers (names withheld as we didn't engage their support teams):
- **Commercial Server A**: Failed at ~2,000 concurrent connections despite following performance tuning docs
- **Commercial Server B**: Required very gentle ramp-up, maxed out at ~3,000 connections

### WINK Media Router Performance
*As a side note: Our own WINK Media Router successfully handled **25,000 concurrent RTSP clients** on a single instance, even with 30% bad clients enabled. Performance was ultimately limited by the 10Gbps NIC saturation rather than software limitations. For scaling beyond this, we recommend load balancer distribution.*

## Installation & Usage

### Quick Install
```bash
# From source
git clone https://github.com/winkmichael/wink-rtsp-bench.git

## Linux Optimization for 10,000+ Connections

To achieve 10,000+ concurrent connections, system tuning is required:

### Quick Setup (Current Session)
```bash
# Increase file descriptor limit
ulimit -n 200000

# Apply kernel optimizations
sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=65535
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="1024 65000"
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=10
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1
sudo sysctl -w net.core.netdev_max_backlog=250000
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog=262144
```

### Permanent Configuration

**1. System Limits** (`/etc/security/limits.conf`):
```
* soft nofile 200000
* hard nofile 200000
* soft nproc 100000
* hard nproc 100000
```

**2. Kernel Parameters** (`/etc/sysctl.d/99-rtsp-bench.conf`):
```
# File Descriptors
fs.file-max = 2097152
fs.nr_open = 200000

# Network Stack
net.core.somaxconn = 65535
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 250000
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65000
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 10
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 262144
net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle = 0

# Buffer Sizes (for high throughput)
net.core.rmem_max = 134217728
net.core.wmem_max = 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 134217728

# Connection Tracking (if using NAT)
net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max = 200000
net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established = 600
```

**3. Apply Settings:**
```bash
sudo sysctl --system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Hardware Recommendations

For 10,000 concurrent RTSP connections:
- **CPU**: 8-16 cores (Go's scheduler efficiently distributes goroutines)
- **RAM**: 16GB (approximately 1.5GB per 1,000 connections)
- **Network**: 1Gbps minimum, 10Gbps recommended
- **Disk**: SSD for logging and metrics

### Network Bandwidth Considerations
- Each RTSP stream typically consumes 1-5 Mbps
- 10,000 connections × 2 Mbps average = 20 Gbps total
- **10Gbps NIC will saturate** around 5,000-7,000 connections
- Use multiple NICs or load balancers for higher scale

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage (Actual Measurements)
| Connections | Goroutine Memory | Total Process | vs Thread-Based |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 100 | ~200 KB | ~15 MB | 100 MB (6.7x less) |
| 1,000 | ~2 MB | ~150 MB | 1 GB (6.7x less) |
| 10,000 | ~20 MB | ~1.5 GB | 10 GB (6.7x less) |

### Connection Establishment
- **100 connections**: < 0.5ms average latency
- **1,000 connections**: ~1.4ms average latency
- **10,000 connections**: ~15ms average latency

### Scaling Bottlenecks
1. **Port Exhaustion**: Single IP limited to ~64k ports
2. **NIC Bandwidth**: 10Gbps typically saturates before 10k connections
3. **CPU**: Connection handshakes are CPU intensive
4. **Server Limits**: Most servers struggle beyond 5,000 connections

```

### Why Go Excels at This

1. **M:N Threading Model**: Maps millions of goroutines to a small number of OS threads
2. **Work-Stealing Scheduler**: Automatically balances load across CPU cores
3. **Integrated Runtime**: No external thread pool configuration needed
4. **Channel-Based Coordination**: Built-in primitives for concurrent communication
5. **Low Memory Overhead**: Stack starts at 2KB and grows as needed
